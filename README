pushift avoider

this is designed to help keep your comments hidden from pushshift, since they are terrible about letting you opt-out

it works by writing a blank comment, and then once praw has scanned it and upladed it to pushift, it will replace the body with what you actually wanted

there should usually be no more than a 1-minute delay in between these steps

please note that before using this tool, you must go through the necessary steps to register your account as a bot, and copy your information to user_data.txt.  Instructions are in the PRAW documentation

This tool is still in development, please do not use it for now
