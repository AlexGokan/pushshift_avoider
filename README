pushift avoider

this is designed to help keep your comments hidden from pushshift, since they are terrible about letting you opt-out

it works by approximating the time that your comment will be scanned by Pushshift, editing it to be blank just before then, and then editing it back once it has confirmed a blank comment has been recorded in pushshift's database

please note that before using this tool, you must go through the necessary steps to register your account as a bot, and copy your information to user_data.txt.  Instructions are in the PRAW documentation

please also note that I do not guarantee that this will catch every comment.  The response time on pushshift can vary quite a bit from day to day and hour to hour, and sometimes a comment may be archived before this script can get to it

This tool is still in development, please do not use it for now
